## Usage

To create partial pages, follow these steps:

1. Create a new HTML file for the partial page, e.g., `partial.html`.
2. Write the HTML content specific to the partial page.
3. Include the partial page in main HTML file using a server-side or client-side templating mechanism. For example, in EJS, you can use the `<%- include('partial.html') %>` syntax.
